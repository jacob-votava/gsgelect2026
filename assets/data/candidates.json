          "statement": "Over the past year, countless graduate students have expressed a similar frustration: that Graduate Student Government is too often disconnected from the students it is meant to represent. Instead of operating as a collective voice, it has become siloed, opaque, and driven by individual priorities rather than community needs. I am running for President because the GSG must belong to the graduate student body, not to whichever officer happens to hold the gavel.\nIf elected, my foremost commitment is accountability, to you, and to the values of transparency and good governance. I will not treat this role as a platform for personal agendas or self-promotion. I will treat it as a responsibility to elevate the concerns of students across divisions, departments, and identities, and to ensure that board actions reflect what our community collectively expresses.\nWe are entering a new fiscal moment where the old way of doing things simply does not work. \u201cBusiness as usual\u201d has produced disengagement, discontent, and policies that do not reflect student priorities. To reverse that pattern, I will:\nRedirect money away from internal board perks (executive stipends, private dinners, etc.) toward student-facing resources, including:\n\u2013 conference & professional travel support\n\u2013 emergency & hardship funds\n\u2013 support for student organizations & cultural groups\n\u2013 subsidized transit initiatives\nIncrease transparency by implementing:\n\u2013 quarterly public budget reviews\n\u2013 \u201cCoffee Chats with the President\u201d\n\u2013 clear annual reporting on spending and outcomes\nRestructure internal governance through:\n\u2013 updated bylaws & spending rules\n\u2013 clarified officer responsibilities & authority\n\u2013 stronger protections against overreach & unilateral actions\nRebuild collaboration and institutional memory by:\n\u2013 coordinating between officers rather than siloing work\n\u2013 training incoming board members for continuity\n\u2013 engaging constructively with university partners and administrators\nI believe the GSG can be more representative, more transparent, more responsive, and more impactful than it has been over the past two years. But that requires leadership willing to embrace reform, prioritize the collective, and align resources with student needs rather than internal preferences. \nI am running to make the GSG work for students again, and I am ready to lead that change, with you, and for you.",

          "statement": "My name is Arafat Safdar and I\u2019m a first-year PhD student at the Department of Near Eastern Studies. I am running for the Graduate Student Government because I want to ensure that the graduate students have a strong and transparent voice representing them in addressing multiple challenges facing our community. \nChief among these is the growing mental health crisis that demands urgent attention. Beyond access to medical and counseling resources, the University must invest in the social and communal infrastructure that promotes student well-being. While the University has spent approximately $300 million in the expansion and renovation of the recently opened Art Museum, graduate students still lack meaningful, shared spaces where they could gather and build a sense of community. Among other things, my top priority will be advocating for an expedited development of dedicated graduate student community spaces. \nAs commendable as the past GSG\u2019s work has been, I believe the body continues to struggle with engagement and visibility among the wider graduate student population. For example, the timing of this year\u2019s nomination and election process - during December/January, when many students are away or preparing for the new semester - highlights a structural problem in how we conduct our democracy. Low turnout and confusion around elections are not signs of disengagement, but of a system that feels remote and confusing for many like me. \nIf elected, I will explore the possibility of constituting a dedicated Outreach Committee (as distinct from Communications) and, if needed, push for a constitutional review process to reassess rules around student participation that no longer reflect the realities of graduate life at Princeton. In my conversations with fellow students, what I have consistently heard is not nonchalant disregard, but confusion about how to get involved in the process through non-Assembly channels.\nWhile I may be relatively new to Princeton, I bring relevant experience from my time at the University of British Columbia-Vancouver, where I worked at the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies for five years - as an executive assistant to the Dean. This role gave me a rare perspective on graduate life from both administrative and student-facing angles. I hope to utilize this experience in contributing meaningfully to the graduate life experience at Princeton.\nI am not running on grand promises. I am running on a commitment to transparency, engagement, and the willingness to initiate honest, sometimes uncomfortable conversations that are long overdue.",

As your current VPIA and former treasurer, I've secured real wins for graduate students: making a \u2018Block32\u2019 graduate meal plan option available starting next year, launching a funding initiative that revived or founded 20+ student organizations, processing funding for over 70 events, saving GSG over $100k through careful financial oversight, helping reverse a $300 meal plan increase, championing bus routes to connect grad residences.\nMy platform (non-exhaustive):\nProtecting Graduate Students from Budget Impacts: Princeton departments are implementing 5-10% budget cuts and admitting fewer students. I will advocate to keep stop-gap funding for canceled grants available, and push against higher and inequitable teaching loads without proper compensation. Through CPUC, I will advocate that stipends increase more than the cost of living, and that we do not face implicit cuts through reductions in student services.\nGSG Financial Transparency and No New Fees without Referendum: I will make all GSG expenses public and require pre-approval in assembly. I'll implement biannual budgeting to curtail officer overspending and ensure fiscal responsibility. Amidst rising living costs, any new fees should require a referendum vote by the graduate student body.\nImproved Health and Leave Policies: I will keep advocating for clear medical leave procedures, continued campus access during leave, and streamlined re-enrollment processes.  will push for better health insurance navigation resources so students don't learn the American healthcare system through costly mistakes. Following the GS faculty committee's recent decision on DCE parental leave, I will work to address the cost and timeline concerns that blocked progress and build administrative support for sustainable family policies.\nFighting for International Students amidst Uncertainty: I will keep working to expand CPT eligibility across departments, speed up re-enrollment to smooth visa renewals, vigilantly monitor threats to OPT/H-1B programs that are critical to career pathways, connect students to resources to resolve double taxation issues and push on proper recognition of external fellowships. \nReimagining Community Programming: The cancellation of Wintersession was sorely felt by our community. I want to gauge interest for a smaller-yet-impactful grad-student-led two-week program in January 2027, aiming to foster similar community and engagement at a fraction of the cost. \nI'm committed to leading a disciplined, transparent, and effective GSG that serves all graduate students.

I am running for Treasurer because I care deeply about ensuring that our limited resources are used transparently and responsibly for the broad benefit of the graduate student community.\n\nThe Princeton GSG operates with a relatively small budget compared to peer institutions but it has used those funds effectively by supporting student organization events, distributing grad sweaters and providing Procter Hall meals. If elected, I intend to continue this tradition of doing more with less. My core priorities are as follows:\n\n1. Increased transparency: Many graduate students are unaware of what the GSG fee is or how exactly their approximately $30 contribution is spent. At the end of every semester, I commit to providing a clear and detailed breakdown of how GSG funds are allocated across events and initiatives, along with accessible explanations of the financial constraints involved in budgeting decisions.\n\nIn addition, student organizations should be able to clearly understand how funding decisions are made. I will work to improve clarity around allocation criteria so that organizations of different sizes and missions have equitable access to resources.\n\n2. Responsible growth of the GSG budget: Building on last year\u2019s work in expanding Graduate School support, I will advocate for continued increases in contributions from the Graduate School and the Office of Campus Life. At the same time, I will explore alternate funding sources from alumni and external partnerships so that we don't have to worry about higher student fees.\n\n3. Increased community involvement: While the GSG strives to allocate funds responsibly, graduate students should have meaningful opportunities to offer feedback. This includes proposing new initiatives for funding as well as voicing concerns about existing ones. I will make an honest effort to incorporate community input into budget planning and ensure that student perspectives are actively considered.\n\nFinally, as a math student, you can trust me to count your money.

Our department was uniquely responsible for generating revenue through external sponsorships, rather than solely distributing existing funds. In that role, I managed budgets for large-scale events such as formals and holiday ceremonies, balancing sponsorship income against event costs while ensuring financial accountability. This experience taught me how proactive financial planning can expand programming without increasing the burden on students.\nAt Princeton, I served as Social Chair for the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, where I organized weekly departmental social hours over the course of a full year. My responsibilities included budgeting, ordering food and beverages, coordinating deliveries, advertising events, and managing post-event logistics. Running recurring events under a fixed budget required careful cost control and consistency, ensuring strong attendance while remaining fiscally responsible.\nIn my research lab, before we had a dedicated lab manager, I was deeply involved in equipment purchasing and travel reimbursements, giving me practical familiarity with Princeton\u2019s Concur system and the end-to-end finance workflow. This experience positions me to help student groups navigate funding processes efficiently and avoid common bottlenecks.\nAs an international student, I am particularly committed to equitable budgeting across cultural backgrounds. This could include supporting events tied to international and cultural holidays\u2014such as Lunar New Year, Diwali, Eid, or Nowruz\u2014so that all students feel represented in GSG-funded programming.\nFinally, I am active in the GSG Slack community, which I view as a critical listening tool. As Treasurer, I would formalize this feedback loop through regular virtual office hours, clear funding updates, and open discussion of spending priorities. My goal is to ensure that GSG budgeting reflects the voices, values, and lived experiences of our graduate students.",

I believe that although the VPIA role is a more inward-facing role, the overall focus of the individual serving should be outward towards the graduate student body. My involvement in the executive board and being in a role that is focused on creating a meaningful and enjoyable experience for Princeton makes me an excellent candidate.  \n\nAs Social Chair, I did not just host happy hours, but sought to provide a variety of experiences to resonate with graduate students from many backgrounds.

Themes for social events included Lego nights, bingo nights, make your own crepes, and plant giveaways. My efforts in this position reflect a leadership style that is intentional, inclusive, and people-centered as I tried to create spaces where community forms organically and where individuals feel welcomed, seen, and engaged.

Teamwork makes the dream work! \n\nI would also like to use this role to provide a consistent source of gentle accountability for GSGboard members. Making sure that the GSG executive team accomplishes what we promise is incredibly important for building trust with the student body. Accountability also means that I will seek to help the initiatives of board members align with the needs of the graduate student body and follow the constitution. \n\nSuccess for the GSG executive board means that steps are taken to improve the lives of Princeton graduate students.

I hope to support all graduate students in conducting their studies as effectively as possible, and I believe serving as Facilities Officer is the most impactful way for me to contribute to this goal.\n \nAs graduate students at Princeton, we face many stresses each day, so broken laundry machines and malfunctioning toilets should not have to be one of these stresses. I seek to enable graduate students to focus on their work and well-being by reducing the nuisances of daily life and making graduate living as headache-free as possible.\n \nMy prior experiences managing maintenance contracts for laboratory equipment while working at a national lab, as well as serving as the housing chair for my fraternity, has prepared me to address the housing, dining, and transportation concerns faced by graduate students. Additionally, my time as president of the Interfraternity Council (IFC) in undergrad exposed me to the complexities of student leadership and institutional bureaucracy, equipping me to navigate and advocate effectively on behalf of graduate students. I plan to take a proactive approach to this role by identifying and addressing facilities and transportation issues before they become a larger problem.\n \nI care deeply about the day-to-day experiences of graduate students and want to ensure that our living and working environments reflect that care. I would be grateful for the opportunity to serve as Facilities Officer and to be a reliable advocate for the graduate community.",

In particular, many graduate students have expressed\nconcern regarding the availability of new and sufficient housing. While I recognize that large-\nscale facilities planning involves complex institutional processes, I believe that the consistent and\norganized communication of student perspectives is essential to informed decision-making.\nIf elected, I will prioritize serving as a bridge between graduate students and the relevant University\ndepartments and advisory bodies, including the Graduate Housing Advisory Board, the Housing\nPolicy Group, and the Transportation Advisory Board. My goal is to ensure that student concerns\nare accurately conveyed, thoughtfully discussed, and clearly followed up on. I am committed to\nlistening carefully to student feedback and representing those views professionally and responsibly.\nI have also heard concerns regarding recent reductions in the frequency and operating hours of on-\ncampus transportation, as well as cuts to on-demand transportation services. While I understand\nthat these changes may be driven by budgetary constraints, I believe that improved communication\nbetween the student community and University departments can help optimize transportation\nschedules and related services. These examples represent only some of the many facilities-related\nissues where regular dialogue and feedback can support more effective and responsive planning.\nBeyond housing and transportation, I aim to support graduate students by advocating for accessible\ndining options and inclusive campus accommodations. I will approach this role with professionalism,\nrespect for University policies, and a commitment to transparent communication.\nThank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Grad-\nuate Student Government election process and to contribute to the graduate student community\nat Princeton University.",

Becoming part of the Graduate Student Government is an ideal way for me to help facilitating the self-organization of our graduate students community, which I consider to be a very meaningful task.\n\nAs Facilities Officer, I would like to work on this task by listening to students' concerns, and supporting you wherever needed when it comes to housing, transportation, and dining.

Experiencing firsthand how difficult it can be to access effective care and accommodations shaped my commitment to student wellness and equity. These experiences motivate my work to make health and wellness more accessible, inclusive, and community-driven for graduate students.\n\nThis year, as GSG Health & Life Officer, I focused on building visible, engaging, and sustainable wellness programming that address my four key pillars of health: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual. I organized a wide range of events, including Women\u2019s History Month Puppy Yoga, wellness candle-making, DIY trail mix and energy bites, crafts workshops, D\u00eda de los Muertos card-making, \u201cTake a Card, Leave a Card\u201d peer encouragement initiatives, holiday cards for troops overseas, student health insurance presentation, and the restart of the Graduate Buddy Program.\n\nDuring a year with budget challenges, I secured external funding from TigerWell, OCE, and VPCL and carefully monitored the Health & Life budget to ensure responsible spending and long-term sustainability. In addition, I served on the TigerWell Grants Advisory Committee, Student Health Plan Advisory Committee, and PUL mental health task force, and collaborated with University Health Services, Graduate Life, and campus leadership to ensure student voices informed health programming.\n\nLooking ahead, I aim to expand culturally inclusive wellness initiatives by collaborating with affinity groups on themed events such as cooking sessions or seed cycling workshops. As a certified yoga/meditation facilitator, I plan to launch fun weekly wellness challenges that foster consistency, connection, and community. I also plan to collaborate with campus partners to organize an on-campus blood draw and health screenings to reduce barriers to preventative care.\n\nAdvocacy will remain central to my role. After nearly having my own medical accommodations denied when I entered graduate school, I am committed to strengthening health accommodations, improving student insurance access, expanding availability of menstrual products, and lowering barriers to outpatient care. I will continue gathering student feedback and working across GSG to ensure all events are inclusive of health needs.\n\nI would be honored to continue serving as your GSG Health & Life Officer and building a healthier, more connected graduate community together.",

These experiences have made me especially aware of how mental health resources, healthcare access, work-life balance, and a sense of community shape our graduate experience far more than we often admit.\n\nIf elected, my priority as Health and Life Officer would be to make support more visible, more accessible, and more responsive to real graduate student needs. This includes working closely with University Health Services and CPS to improve clarity around appointments and coverage, advocating for better communication about existing resources (many of which are underused simply because they\u2019re hard to find), and supporting initiatives that reduce isolation\u2014especially for international students, first-generation students, and those navigating particularly demanding stages of their programs.\n\nI also care deeply about creating low-stakes, welcoming spaces where graduate students can connect beyond their departments. Sometimes what we need most isn\u2019t another policy change, but a reminder that we\u2019re not alone\u2014and that it\u2019s okay to ask for help.\n\nOutside of research, I enjoy teaching, data projects, and long conversations over coffee about anything from labor economics to where to find the best dumplings near campus. I\u2019d be honored to serve the graduate community in this role and to work collaboratively with fellow GSG members to make Princeton a healthier, kinder place to do graduate work.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nWarmly,\nHantao Wu",

It\u2019s also about community, transparency, and feeling that someone has your\nback when things get complicated.\nAs an international student doing my PhD in engineering here, I know very well what it\nmeans to arrive in the U.S. from abroad: the paperwork, the visa questions, the cultural\ndifferences and that overwhelming feeling at the beginning (and sometimes well after the\nbeginning too). If elected as International Student Affairs Officer, my main goal will be to\nstrengthen support for international grads and make sure nobody is left without clear and\naccessible information.\nI want to help make things easier.

Navigating the current turbulent immigration landscape is not easy, especially as the Davis IC cannot provide immigration advice beyond the current F1/J1 visa landscape, and many miss out on helpful pathways to achieve visa security post graduation. With that in mind here are my priorities:\n\nFree Immigration Attorney Consultations: I will advocate for the Davis IC to start a pilot program offering free immigration attorney consultations. This would be the most useful resource available to international students to obtain specific case-by-case information about their personal situation and about visa opportunities after the F1/J1.\n\nStreamlined CPT/OPT process through the Davis IC: Improve and expand the CPT/OPT application process by having the relevant information more broadly available and shared at the academic department level, where the relevant authorizations and administration burden is usually slowest.\n\nI will prioritize practical solutions and gather feedback through surveys throughout the year to gauge what concerns need to be addressed as the immigration landscape evolves. Finally I will build on the excellent community building initiatives from the past like the Eurovision Night. I hope to earn your vote!",

I am running for International Student Affairs Officer because I care deeply about improving the everyday experience of international graduate students at Princeton.\nI have studied and lived across China, Singapore, and the United States, and like many international students at Princeton, I have navigated multiple academic systems, cultural expectations, and institutional structures. These experiences have shaped how I approach communication and advocacy. I understand that challenges faced by international students are often not isolated issues, but the result of overlapping pressures related to immigration status, academic expectations, cultural adjustment, and access to information and support.\nEspecially during periods of uncertainty and transition, international students often carry additional layers of stress while continuing to meet the demands of graduate life. I want to be part of a community that looks out for one another and ensures that no one feels they have to navigate these challenges alone. For me, serving in this role is about showing up consistently, listening carefully, and helping sustain a sense of stability and mutual support within the international student community.\nAt Princeton, I have seen how timely communication and clear guidance can significantly reduce stress and uncertainty, and how the absence of these can leave students feeling isolated or overlooked. I have personally benefited from, and volunteered at, the annual Garage Giveaway, a free furniture and household item distribution that supports incoming and transitioning international students and scholars. Participating in this initiative has shown me the importance of practical, community-driven support and how small, well-organized efforts can make a meaningful difference during periods of transition.\nAs International Student Affairs Officer, I hope to build on this perspective by serving as a reliable bridge between international graduate students, the Graduate Student Government, and the Davis International Center. I am interested in strengthening coordination, improving the accessibility of information and resources, and supporting initiatives that address both immediate needs and longer-term challenges faced by international students.\nI believe effective representation requires careful listening, transparency, and follow-through.

While my perspective is rooted in the ECE department, conversations with peers across the university have convinced me that administrative friction is a systemic issue. Whether you work in a lab, an archive, or a library, I have seen how much unnecessary stress is generated by the mechanics of our degree programs regardless of the field.\nCurrently, core academic functions, from establishing effective communication with advisors to navigating the general examination, often act as sources of friction rather than support.

Advisor-Student Dynamics The relationship with an advisor is the single biggest factor in a PhD student\u2019s success, yet it currently lacks sufficient structure. I intend to advocate for:\n\u2022 Feedback Standards: Establishing norms to prevent common pitfalls such as lack of timely feedback or, conversely, counterproductive micromanagement.\n\u2022 Expectation Alignment: Encouraging standardized \"advising agreements\" early in the process to align expectations regarding work hours and milestones.\n\u2022 A Clear Grievance Process: ensuring there is a transparent, neutral pathway to resolve conflicts when the advisor-student relationship breaks down, without fear of professional repercussions.\n2.
